## Week 3: Variational Autoencoders (VAE)

**Date:** 28-01-2026

---

## Overview

This week focuses on implementing and training a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**, a probabilistic generative model that learns to encode data into a latent space and decode it back to generate new samples.

## Key Tasks

- Studied the architecture of Variational Autoencoders (VAE)
- Implemented encoder and decoder neural networks
- Applied the reparameterization trick for latent space sampling
- Trained the VAE on a sample dataset
- Visualized latent space representations and generated samples
